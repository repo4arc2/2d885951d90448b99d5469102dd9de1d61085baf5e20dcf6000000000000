{\an8}前情提要

12
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,800
情况是有八名超级士兵在运输大宗货物  为什么
It's we've got eight Super Soldiers on a bulk supply run. Why?

13
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,960
他们说他们的任务是
They say their mission is to

14
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,930
让一切恢复到"闪烁"期间的样子
get things back to the way it was during The Blip.

15
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,040
也许他们只是想帮忙
Maybe they're just trying to help.

16
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,690
那血清的过去可不光彩
That serum doesn't exactly have a great track record.

17
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,100
所以你是说  几十年前有个黑人超级士兵
So you're telling me that there was a Black Super Soldier

18
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,240
但是却没人知道
decades ago and nobody knew about it?

19
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,160
你知道他们是怎么对待我的吗  他们抽我的血
You know what they did to me? People taking my blood.

山姆  我们去把盾牌拿走吧
Let's take the shield, Sam.

22
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,530
你还记得我们上次偷盾牌之后发生的事吗
You remember what happened the last time we stole it?

23
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,090
也许吧
Maybe.

莎伦被列为国家公敌

史蒂夫相信你
Steve believed in you.

27
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,130
他把盾给了你
So he gave you that shield,

28
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,970
你却根本不当一回事  直接扔了
and you threw it away like it was nothing.

29
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,440
-闭嘴  -也许他是看错你了
- Shut up. - So maybe he was wrong about you.

30
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
如果他看错了你
And if he was wrong about you,

31
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,150
那他也看错了我
then he was wrong about me.

32
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,300
我们一直在追查那些
We've been targeting civilians

我知道你想干什么  不行
I know where you're going with this, no.

39
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,270
他知道九头蛇所有秘密  你忘了西伯利亚的事了吗
He knows all of HYDRA's secrets. Don't you remember Siberia?

40
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,500

- He says he doesn't know. - Bullshit. That's bullshit.

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,020
我们知道她来过这里  她去哪了
We know she came through here. Now where'd she go?

68
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,660
你知道我是谁吗

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,330
我知道  我不在乎
Yes, I do. And I don't care.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,050
这就是浪费时间  我们找不到他们的
It's a waste of time, man. We ain't gonna find 'em.

71
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,860
兰利那边有人联系你了吗
You heard anything back from anybody at Langley?

72
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,950
没
Nah.

73
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,860
卡莉肯定有我不知道的资源和人脉
Karli must be funneling something from someone I can't see.

74
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,870
听着  她在给流离失所的人提供庇护和药物
Listen, she's giving displaced people shelter and medicine.

75
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,560
-我知道  -那是能够培养忠诚的
- I know. - That kinda thing creates loyalty, man.

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,260
我知道你想抓到她  我理解
I know you want this. I get it.

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,400
但我们真的已经用尽一切办法了
But we've literally tried everything we can here.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,510
兰利也是  我们总是无功而返
So has Langley, and we keep drawin' blanks.

79
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,320
那我们就把注压在牌更好的人身上
So we bet on someone who's got a better hand.

80
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,480

- He's just through that corridor. - All right. Give us a sec.

82
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,210
-我要一个人去  -为什么
- I'm gonna go in alone. - Why?

83
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,330
因为你是复仇者  你清楚他对此的感受
Cause you're an Avenger. You know how he feels about that.

84
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,850
你们又不是
Well, it's not like you two were known

85
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,390
一起走阳光下嬉戏的朋友
for frolickin' in the sun together.

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,680
他曾痴迷于九头蛇
He was obsessed with HYDRA.

87

我们有共同点  相信我

我知道
I know.

95
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,820
我只想看看新的你对旧的词会有什么反应
I just wanted to see how the new you reacts to the old words.

96
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,220
还有点什么在
Something is still in there.

97
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,370
至少你被囚禁时  大部分时间不是清醒的
At least you were not conscious for most of your imprisonment.

98
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,960
那段时光也并不轻松
That time wasn't exactly a picnic.

99
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,640
不管怎样  我很抱歉
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,120
那从不是针对你
It was never personal.

101
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,370
你不过是达成一个必要结果的手段
You were simply a means to a necessary end.

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,890
有人重制了超级士兵血清
Someone recreated the super-soldier serum.

103
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,890
我需要查明是谁
I need to find out who.

104
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,620
你认为这跟九头蛇有关
You are assuming HYDRA has something to do with this,

105
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,130
所以才来找我
which is why you came to me,

106
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,890
所以说你很绝望
which means you are desperate.

107
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,600
你走运了  我知道从哪查起
Luckily for you, I know where to begin.

108
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,440
你说什么呢  你要帮泽莫越狱
What are you talking about? You wanna break Zemo outta jail?

109
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,500
我们在哪  巴基  你疯了吗
Where are we, Buck? Have you lost your mind?

110
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,400
我们没有线索  没有办法  什么都没有
We have no leads, no moves, nothing.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,990
但我们把
Yeah, what we have

112
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,670
全世界最危险的人之一关在牢房里了
is one of the most dangerous men in the world behind bars.

113
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,630
我们还需要抓八个在逃的超级士兵
And we also have eight Super Soldiers that are loose.

114
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,590
泽莫会扰乱我们的心智的  尤其是你的
Look, Zemo's gonna mess with our minds. Especially yours.

115
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,020
别介意
No offense.

116
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,150
介意
Offense.

117
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,930
超级士兵违背他的一切信条
Super Soldiers go against everything he believes in.

118
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,110
他虽然疯了  但还有原则
He is crazy, but he still has a code.

119
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,200
而我就违背了他的原则  巴基  你也是
I've been on the wrong side of that code, Buck, and so have you.

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,690
他炸了联合国  杀了特查卡国王  还栽赃给你
He blew up the UN, he killed King T'Chaka and framed you for it.

121
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,520
你忘了吗  你觉得瓦坎达人都忘了吗
Did you forget that? You think the Wakandans forgot about it?

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,940
这是反问句  他们没忘
It's a rhetorical question. They didn't.

123
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,140
我知道你为什么这么在意这个
I know why this matters to you, but

124
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,700
但拜托  你要为之着魔了
come on, it's pushing you off the deep end.

125
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,680
山姆  我们不清楚他们哪来的血清
Sam, we don't know how they're gettin' the serum.

126
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,650
我们都不知道他们有多少人
We don't even know how many of them there are.

127
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,230
我来给你说个假设情况
Look, let me just walk you through a hypothetical.

128
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,870
能不能让我给你说个假设情况
Can I walk you through a hypothetical?

129
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,510
-你做了什么  -我什么都没做
- What did you do? - I didn't do anything.

130
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,220
你在读什么书
What's the book you're reading?

131
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,420
马基雅维利写的
Machiavelli.

132
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,870
任何系统最弱的点
The weakest point in any system

133
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,580
不是软件  硬件  而是肉件
isn't the software, the hardware, it's the meatware.

134
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,140
是人的因素
The human element.

135
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,240
在这个监狱里  囚犯/看守比是9:1
Now, in this lockup, it's nine to one, prisoners to guards.

136
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,280
如果两名囚犯打了起来
And if two prisoners start fighting,

137
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,720
按规章  得有四名看守响应
then the protocol says four guards have to respond.

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,210
怎么那时会
So why would two prisoners

139
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,900
刚好有两名囚犯打起来
randomly start fighting at that moment?

140
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,930
谁知道  可能原因多的是
Who knows? There could be many reasons...

141
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,120
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}他今晚就会杀了你

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,120
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}先下手为强

143
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,250
重点是  这种事会升级
But the point is, these things escalate.

144
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,470
于是只能启动封锁程序
Lockdown procedures would have to be initiated,

145
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,770
因为有那么多人打得飞起
and with all those bodies flying around left and right,

146
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,950
可以轻松溜过一两条走廊
wouldn't be hard to slip down a hallway or two.

147
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}门茨看守

148
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,950
如果在分离囚犯时
And if the fire alarm got tripped

149
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,370
触发了火警警报
while the prisoners were being separated...

150
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,650
就有人可以利用这种混乱
...someone could use the chaos to their advantage.

151
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,220
我不喜欢你讲得如此轻松
I don't like how casual you're bein' about this.

152
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,470
这不自然  你...
This is unnatural. Are you...

153
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,690
还有  我们在哪
And where are we, man?

154
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,370
-听着  -你怎么在这里
- No, listen. - What are you doin' here?

155
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,120
我不想告诉你
I didn't want to tell you

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,590
因为我知道你不会同意的  好吗
'cause I knew you wouldn't let this happen. Okay?

157
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,230
-你做了什么  -我们需要他  山姆
- What did you do? - We need him, Sam.

158
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,520
-你给我回监狱去  -容我说一句...
- You're going back to prison! - If I may...

159
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
别
No!

160
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,840
抱歉
Apologies.

161
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,610
史蒂夫拒签《索科威亚协议》时  你支持了他
When Steve refused to sign the Sokovia Accords, you backed him.

162
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,510
你犯了法  为我铤而走险
You broke the law, and you stuck your neck out for me.

163
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
我在求你再做一次
I'm asking you to do it again.

164
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,240
-我真的认为我很有价值...  -闭嘴
- I really think I'm invaluable... - Shut up.

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,540
好吧
Okay.

166
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,810
如果我们要这么做
If we do this,

167
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,990
你无论做什么  都得先请示我们
you don't make a move without our permission.

168
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,480
好吧
Fair.

169
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,820
好  泽莫
Okay, Zemo,

170
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,430
我们从哪查起
where do we start?

171
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,480
{\an8}猎鹰与冬兵
第一季  第三集

172
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,350
所以我们第一步就是偷车吗
So our first move is grand theft auto?

173
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,650
这些都是我的  是家族的世代收藏
These are mine. Collected by family over the generations.

174
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,070
我花了数年时间搜寻九头蛇招募过的人
I spent years hunting people HYDRA recruited

175
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,040
好重制血清
to recreate the serum.

176
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,370
因为一旦它出现
Because once it's out there,

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,960
就有人能制造一支大军
someone can create an army of people...

178
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,770
比如复仇者
like the Avengers.

179
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,690
我终止过一次冬日战士项目
I ended the Winter Soldier program once before.

180
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,490
我可不想丢下做到一半的工作
I have no intention to leave my work unfinished.

181
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,350
为达目的  我们得从最低层的人渣往上查
To do this, we'll have to scale a ladder of lowlifes.

182
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,400
加入进来吧  我们已经开始了
Well, join the party. We've already started.

183
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,570
第一站是一个叫塞尔比的女人
First stop is a woman named Selby.

184
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,290
中层黑市贩子  我跟她还有联系  从她往上查
Mid-level fence I still have a line on. From there, we climb.

185
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,430
原来你一直很有钱吗
So all this time you've been rich?

186
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,890
我是个男爵  山姆
I'm a Baron, Sam.

187
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,110
你的朋友们还没毁掉我的国家时  我家是皇族
My family was royalty until your friends destroyed my country.

188
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,540
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}你好  奥兹尼克

189
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,710
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}欢迎  先生们

190
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,250
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}老朋友

191
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,500
请吧
Please.

192
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,350
我很抱歉  酒不够冰
Apologies if that's a little warm,

193
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,970
冰箱坏了
the fridge is out.

194
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,690
但我会找找看厨房里还有没有美食
But I will see if there is some good food in the galley.

195
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,330
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}如果闻起来不对劲的话

196
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,320
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}就给他们吃

197
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,240
您回来了真好  先生
It's good to have you back, sir.

198
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,020
你不知道被关在牢房里是什么滋味
You don't know what it's like to be locked in a cell.

199
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,970
不对  你知道的
That's right. You do.

200
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,080
不如给我们详细讲讲  我们要去哪里
Why don't you tell us about where we're going?

201
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,250
我就是读这个读得入了迷
I was just fascinated by this.

203
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,620
{\an8}中岛

204
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,510
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know what to call it,

205
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,400
但这部分好像很重要
but this part seems to be important.

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,610
中岛是谁
Who is Nakajima?

207
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,600
再碰它我就杀了你
If you touch that again, I'll kill you.

208
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,840
对不起
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,930
我懂你的名单
I understand that list of names.

210
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,930
是你做冬兵时亏待过的人
People you've wronged as the Winter Soldier.

211
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,890
别太过分了
Don't push it.

212
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,810
我见过那本笔记本
I've seen that book.

213
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,230
史蒂夫刚从冰层里出来时用过它
It was Steve's when he came out of the ice.

214
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,710
我给他讲了《黑手煞星》那首歌  他记在了上面
I told him about Trouble Man. He wrote it in that book.

215
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,660
你听了吗  觉得怎么样
Did you hear it? What'd you think?

216
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
我喜欢四十年代的音乐  所以...
I like '40s music, so...

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,680
-你不喜欢吗  -喜欢
- You didn't like it? - I liked it.

218
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,020
那是一曲杰作  詹姆斯  完成度高  无所不包
It is a masterpiece, James. Complete. Comprehensive.

219
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,620
它捕捉到了非裔美国人的经历
It captures the African-American experience.

220
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,780
他好过分  但他说得对
He's out of line, but he's right.

221
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,470
非常棒
It's great.

222
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,070
人人都爱马文·盖伊
Everybody loves Marvin Gaye.

223
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,100
我喜欢马文·盖伊
I like Marvin Gaye.

224
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
史蒂夫崇拜马文·盖伊
Steve adored Marvin Gaye.

225
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,210
你肯定真心仰慕史蒂夫
You must have really looked up to Steve.

226
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,870
但我见到他的时候  我发现了一件事
But I realized something when I met him.

227
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,330
他这种人的风险
The danger with people like him,

228
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,540
美国的超级士兵的风险在于  我们把他们奉为完人
America's Super Soldiers, is that we put them on pedestals.

229
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,950
说话小心点  泽莫
Watch your step, Zemo.

230
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,230
他们会变成符号  偶像
They become symbols. Icons.

231
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,880
然后我们开始忘掉他们的缺点
And then we start to forget about their flaws.

232
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,400
从那开始  城市浮到半空  无辜百姓死去
From there, cities fly, innocent people die.

233
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,460
运动酝酿成型  战争接连不断
Movements are formed, wars are fought.

234
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,730
你记得吧
You remember that, right?

235
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,860
毕竟你曾是一名被派往德国
As a young soldier sent to Germany

236
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,550
遏止被狂热崇拜的偶像的年轻士兵
to stop a mad icon.

237
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,840
我们愿意活在一个满是红骷髅那种人的世界里吗
Do we want to live in a world full of people like the Red Skull?

238
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,610
所以我们要去马德里坡
That is why we're going to Madripoor.

239
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,370
马德里坡怎么了
What's up with Madripoor?

240
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,460
你们把它说得像骷髅岛一样
You guys talk about it like it's Skull Island.

241
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,580
它是印尼群岛的一个岛国
It's an island nation in the Indonesian archipelago.

242
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,400
19世纪时  曾是海盗的避难所
It was a pirate sanctuary back in the 1800s.

243
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,760
它保持了一贯的无法律状态至今
It's kept its lawless ways.

244
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,060
但我们不能用真实身份直接走进去
But we cannot exactly walk in as ourselves.

245
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,270
詹姆斯  你得当一个你说已经消失的人
James, you will have to become someone you claim is gone.

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,780
{\an8}全球回归委员会安置营
拉脱维亚  里加

247
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,220
卡莉
Karli!

248
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,650
你最好上楼看看
You better come upstairs.

249
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,410
时间所剩不多了
There's not much time.

250
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,480
你陪着她吧
You should be with her now.

251
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,970
她肯定想让你陪
She'd want that.

252
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,660
对不起
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,920
{\an8}马德里坡

254
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,510
我们得做点什么
We have to do something about this.

255
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,480
只有我扮得像个拉皮条的
I'm the only one who looks like a pimp.

256
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,590
只有美国人才会觉得
Only an American would assume

257
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,080
穿着前卫的黑人像拉皮条的
a fashion-forward Black man looks like a pimp.

258
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,990
你看上去跟你应该扮的人一模一样
You look exactly like the man you're supposed to be playing.

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,570
那个老谋深算又英俊迷人的黑人花花公子
The sophisticated, charming African rake

260
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,350
名叫康拉德·麦克  绰号笑面虎
named Conrad Mack, aka the Smiling Tiger.

261
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,230
他连绰号都好难听
He even has a bad nickname.

262
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,730
天啊  但他真的很像我
Hell, he does look like me, though.

263
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,650
你闻到了吗
You smell this?

264
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,190
闻到了  是什么  迷幻药吗
Yeah, what is that? Acid?

265
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,620
是马德里坡
Madripoor.

266
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,010
不管发生什么  我们都不能出戏
No matter what happens, we have to stay in character.

267
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,870
我们能不能活命就看演技了  没有出错的余地
Our lives depend on it. There's no margin for error.

268
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,960
高城在那边
High Town's that way.

269
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,140
如果你想逛逛  高城很不错
Not a bad place if you wanna visit,

270
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,220
但低城在另一边
but Low Town's the other way.

271
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,080
我猜我们在高城没有朋友
Let me guess. We don't have any friends in High Town.

272
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,630
到了
Here we are.

273
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,770
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}愿意服从吗

274
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,280
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}冬日战士

275
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,980
那是冬兵吗
Is that the Winter Soldier?

276
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,690
先生们你们好  我没想到你会来  笑面虎
Hello, gentlemen. Wasn't expecting you, Smiling Tiger.

277
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,970
他计划有变  我们找塞尔比有事
His plans changed. We have business to do with Selby.

278
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,550
老样子吗
The usual?

279
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,920
笑面虎  你的最爱
Smiling Tiger, your favorite.

280
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,440
我超爱的
I love these.

281
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,820
干杯  康拉德
Cheers, Conrad.

282
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,040
高层授意我  你在这里不受欢迎
I got word from on high. You ain't welcome here.

283
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,620
我要找的不是权力掮客
I have no business with the Power Broker,

284
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,720
但如果他执意  他要么来跟我谈谈...
but if he insists, he can either come and talk to me...

285
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,380
新发型吗
New haircut?

286
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,470
要么带塞尔比来找我谈
Or bring Selby for a chat.

287
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,320
还权力掮客  真的假的
A power broker? Really?

288
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,000
群龙不能无首
Every kingdom needs its king.

289
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,900
祈祷我们不要被他发现吧
Let's just pray we stay under his radar.

290
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,680
-你认识他吗  -只是听说过
- Do you know him? - Only by reputation.

291
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,010
在马德里坡他是法官  是陪审团  也是刽子手
In Madripoor he is judge, jury, and executioner.

292
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,050
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}冬日战士

293
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,300
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}攻击

294
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,250
没过多久他就又恢复了状态
Didn't take much for him to fall back into form.

295
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,820
别出戏  不然整个酒吧都要与我们为敌了
Stay in character or the whole bar turns on us.

296
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,590
{\an2}{\pos(188,215)}做得好  士兵

297
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,620
塞尔比现在见你们
Selby will see you now.

298
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,790
谢谢
Thank you.

299
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,360
你没事吧
You good?

300
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,020
你应该明白  男爵
You should know, Baron.

301
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,590
人们不会径直走进我的酒吧  跟我提要求
People don't just come into my bar and make demands.

302
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,080
不是要求  是提议
Not a demand. An offer.

303
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,040
自你上次来过之后  很多事情都变了
A lot has changed since you were here last.

304
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,770
对了  我还以为你要烂在德国的某座监狱里了
By the way, I thought you were rotting away in a German prison.

305
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:46,320
你是怎么越狱的
How did you escape?

306
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,770
我们这样的人总能找到办法  对吧
People like us always find a way, don't we?

307
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,660
你肯定已经猜到我为何而来了
I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm here for.

308
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,870
你比人们传说中的高  笑面虎
You're taller than I'd heard, Smiling Tiger.

309
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,560
你有什么提议
What's the offer?

310
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,540
告诉我们  你对超级士兵血清有什么了解
Tell us what you know about the super-soldier serum.

311
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,920
我就把他送给你
And I give you him,

312
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,090
当然了  还有控制他的口令词
along with the code words to control him, of course.

313
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,010
你说什么他都照做
He will do anything you want.

314
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,270
这才是我印象中的泽莫嘛
Now that's the Zemo I remember.

315
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,780
我很庆幸  自己刚才没有立即干掉你
I'm glad I decided not to kill you immediately.

316
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,950
你找我就对了
Yeah, you were right to come to me.

317
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,800
嚣张  但你做得对
Arrogant, but right.

318
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,150
超级士兵血清就在这里  就在马德里坡
The super-soldier serum is here in Madripoor.

319
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,180
威尔弗雷德·内格尔博士
Dr. Wilfred Nagel

320
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,400
是你应该感谢的人  或者...
is the man you wanna thank. Or...

321
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,290
谴责  态度取决于你是哪边的
condemn, depending on what side of this you're on.

322
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,450
权力掮客让他研发血清  但是...
The Power Broker had him working on the serum, but...

323
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,210
过程出了岔子
things didn't go as planned.

324
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,090
内格尔还在马德里坡吗
Is Nagel still in Madripoor?

325
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,480
面包屑可以免费送你
The bread crumbs you can have for free,

326
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,960
但面包房可要让你花一大笔钱了  男爵
but the bakery is gonna cost you, Baron.

327
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,180
你可别动歪心思
And before you get all cute,

328
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,600
别以为离了我你也能找到内格尔
don't think you can find Nagel without me.

329
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,580
{\an8}莎拉

330
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,670
接啊
Answer it.

331
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,900
开扬声器
On speaker.

332
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,180
喂
Hello?

333
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,090
我们得谈谈现在的情况
Hey, um, we need to talk about this situation.

334
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,830
我要疯了
It's been drivin' me nuts.

335
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,770
你说的是什么情况
What situation exactly are you talkin' about?

336
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,500
你嗑嗨了吗
Are you high?

337
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,430
你清楚是什么情况  就是你我面对的唯一情况
You know what situation, it's the only situation me and you have.

338
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,270
什么情况  莎拉  讲出来
What situation, Sarah? Say it.

339
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,330
那条破船  还有  注意你的态度  明白吗
The damn boat. And watch your tone. Okay?

340
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,170
去银行那天我暂且放过你了
I let you slide at the bank.

341
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,890
银行  可不是嘛
The bank. Yeah.

342
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,050
洗了那么多钱...  银行会反应过来的
Laundered so much mon... Yeah, they'll come around.

343
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,840
要真是这样  那他们怎么把你赶出去了呢  大佬
If that was the case, then why'd they dog you out, Big Time?

344
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,250
你算是说对了  我就是大佬
Yeah, you damn right I'm Big Time.

345
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,460
你等着  我派人干掉那银行职员
You'll see when I have that banker killed.

346
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,390
凯斯  麦片的事  我怎么跟你说的
Cass! What'd I tell you about the Cheerios?

347
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,610
我可没空管你这个
I don't have time for this!

348
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,570
山姆  抱歉  我之后再打给你吧
Sam, I'm sorry. Look, let me call you back.

349
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,720
"山姆"
"Sam"?

350
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,370
谁是山姆
Who's Sam?

351
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,990
干掉他们
Kill them!

352
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,060
他们会怪在我们头上的
They're gonna pin this on us.

353
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,810
我们真有麻烦了
We have a real problem now,

354
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,210
你们扔下武器  按我说的做
so leave your weapons and follow my lead.

355
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,510
{\an8}塞尔比死了  干掉杀她的凶手  赏金一千比特币

356
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,510
不妙
This is not good.

357
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,890
-该死  -快走
- Shit! - Come on!

358
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,500
我穿着这双高跟鞋跑不快
I can't run in these heels!

359
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,380
看来你们有守护天使
You seem to have a guardian angel.

360
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,880
这真是太完美了
Well, this is too perfect.

361
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,720
放下枪  泽莫
Drop it, Zemo.

362
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,640
莎伦
Sharon?

363
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,180
你害我失去了一切
You cost me everything.

364
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,220
莎伦  等等
Sharon, wait.

365
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,710
有人重制了超级士兵血清  泽莫有线索
Someone recreated the super-soldier serum and Zemo had a lead.

366
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,890
所以你们来了  塞尔比死了
That explains why you guys are here. And Selby's dead.

367
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,320
那你来做什么
So what are you doing here?

368
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
我偷了史蒂夫的盾牌  记得吗
I stole Steve's shield, remember?

369
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,500
我也帮你拿回了你的翅膀
I also took the wings for your ass,

370
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,660
这样你就可以从他手里救他的小命
so that you could save his ass from his ass.

371
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,490
我不像你有复仇者支援我
Unlike you, I didn't have the Avengers to back me up.

372
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,650
所以我在马德里坡隐居
So I'm off the grid in Madripoor.

373
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,810
少唬我了  我也逃亡过
Don't blow that smoke in me. I was on the run, too.

374
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,600
"逃亡过"和"正在逃亡"  区别很大
Was. Is. Big difference.

375
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,500
我已经不再联系我家人了
I don't speak to my family anymore.

376
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,280
我不能
I can't.

377
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,890
-连我爸都不知道我在哪  -听着
- My own father doesn't know where I am. - Listen...

378
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,410
莎伦  我们需要你帮忙
Sharon, we need your help.

379
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,640
求你了
Please.

380
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,010
这事还没完
This isn't over.

381
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,110
我在高城有个住处
I have a place in High Town.

382
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,690
你们去那里暂时应该还算安全
You should be safe there for a while.

383
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,540
看来你因为违法过得还挺滋润
Looks like breaking all those laws is treating you well.

384
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,190
有一刻  我想如果我不得不亡命
At some point, I thought if I had to hustle,

385
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,040
不如享受这种亡命徒的生活
I might as well enjoy the life of a real hustler.

386
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,670
你知道卖一幅莫奈的真迹我能赚多少钱吗
You know how much I can get for a real Monet?

387
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,280
放松  跟我们你就别唬人了  你卖莫奈画赝品
Easy, deactivate your hustle mode. You sell fake Monets.

388
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,550
不  她指的是真品
No. She means real.

389
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,580
这个画廊专门买卖偷来的艺术品
This gallery is specialized in stolen artwork.

390
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,090
莫奈  梵高  古典主义的画
Monet. Van Gogh. Classics.

391
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,010
没错
It's true.

392
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,820
在卢浮宫博物馆等地方  半数艺术品都是赝品
You know, half the artwork in museums like the Louvre is fake.

393
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,840
真品都在这种地方
Real stuff sits in places like this.

394
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,800
我知道你们什么意思了
Okay, guys, I see what you're doing.

395
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,030
你们比老好人山姆更懂世故
You're more worldly than good old Sam.

396
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,960
是啊  谷歌怎么说
Yeah. What's Google say?

397
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,140
-不是吧  -来吧  你们要换身衣服
- No shit. - Come on, you guys need to change.

398
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,760
一小时后我要见客户
I'm hosting clients in an hour.

399
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,990
好多了
Much better.

400
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,620
你怎么了  莎伦  你都不想回家吗
What's going on, Sharon? You don't ever wanna come back home?

401
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,740
我一踏入美国  他们就会把我关起来
They'll lock me up if I step foot back in the States.

402
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,290
马德里坡不允许引渡
Madripoor doesn't allow extradition.

403
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,920
对不起我没打过电话
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call,

404
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,220
但是在"闪烁"和混乱之后  我...
but after The Blip and the chaos, I just...

405
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,120
你知道做英雄就是个笑话吧
Look, you know the whole hero thing is a joke, right?

406
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,050
你放弃盾牌
I mean, the way you gave up that shield,

407
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,530
内心深处  你肯定知道这都是虚伪的
deep down, you must know it's all hypocrisy.

408
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,710
他知道  而且他明知自己清楚
He knows. And not so deep down.

409
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,180
话说  新队长怎么样
By the way, how is the new Cap?

410
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,440
别提了
Don't get me started.

411
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,750
拜托  你对星条旗什么的深信不疑
Please. You buy into all that stars and stripes bullshit.

412
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,510
你变成听命于他的精神病患者之前
Before you were his pet psychopath,

413
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,560
你可是美国先生  队长最好的朋友
you were Mr. America! Cap's best friend.

414
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,270
她现在真吓人
She's kind of awful now.

415
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,450
卡莉·摩根索还有至少另外七人注射了血清
Karli Morgenthau and at least seven others have taken the serum.

416
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,200
为了你们自己的安全
You guys really should steer clear of all of this

417
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,990
你们真的应该避开这一切
for your own safety.

418
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,210
我们知道很冒险  但我们不会走的
We know it's a risk, but we're not gonna leave

419
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,110
除非我们找到破解了配方的人
until we find the person who cracked the code.

420
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,710
我们查到了一个名字  威尔弗雷德·内格尔
We got a name. Wilfred Nagel.

421
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,140
内格尔是权力掮客的人
Nagel works for the Power Broker.

422
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,760
我们需要你帮忙  莎伦  我可以帮你洗清罪名
We need your help, Sharon. I can get your name cleared.

423
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,020
你在拿我的命讨价还价吗
You haggling with my life?

424
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,990
-不是的  -我不相信
- Not like that. - I don't buy that

425
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,790
你假装你能帮我洗清罪名
you pretending like you can clear my name.

426
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,580
也许是很虚伪
Okay, maybe it is hypocrisy.

427
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,280
也许你说得对  你遭受的这些
Maybe you're right. What happened to you.

428
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,900
但如果你愿意试一试  我也愿意试着帮你
But I'm willing to try if you are.

429
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,030
他们帮瞪眼机器人洗清了罪名
They cleared the bionic staring machine,

430
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,720
要知道他之前几乎是见谁杀谁
and he killed almost everybody he's met.

431
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,210
-我听到了  -我不相信施舍
- I heard that. - I don't trust charity.

432
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,050
那就做个交易
All right, a deal then.

433
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,260
你帮我们  我帮你洗清罪名
You help us out, and I get your name cleared.

434
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,060
我把画卖给一些人脉很广的人
Well, I sell to some pretty connected people.

435
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,780
保持低调  融入人群  好好享受派对
Lay low, blend in, enjoy the party.

436
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,510
尽量别惹麻烦  我看看能找到什么
Try to stay outta trouble. I'll see what I can find.

437
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,610
麻烦
Trouble.

438
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,560
各位  我找到他了
Hey, guys. I found him.

439
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,340
走着
Here we go.

440
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,690
马德里坡跟纽约也不相上下嘛
Madripoor could give New York a run for its money.

441
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,030
他们是派对行家
They know how to party.

442
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,730
你们的命跟赏金挂钩
With that bounty on your head,

443
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,820
你们在马德里坡待得越久
the longer you're in Madripoor,

444
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,420
就越难以离开
the less likely you're ever leaving.

445
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,920
他就在这里
All right. He's in there.

446
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,600
集装箱编号4261
Container four-two-six-one.

447
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,230
你们和内格尔谈谈  我把风
Look, I'll keep an eye while you guys talk to Nagel.

448
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,130
但是动作快点  我们时间紧迫
But hurry. We're on borrowed time.

449
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,660
莎伦  你确定是这个集装箱吗
Hey, Sharon. You sure this is the right one?

450
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,970
里面什么都没有
It's completely empty.

451
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,730
确定  错不了
Positive. It has to be.

452
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,250
内格尔博士
Dr. Nagel?

453
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,990
你是谁  想干什么
Who are you? What do you want?

454
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,190
我们知道是你发明了超级士兵血清
We know you created the super-soldier serum.

455
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,930
从我的实验室滚出去
Get out of my lab.

456
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,330
你知道他是谁吧
You know who he is, right?

457
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,370
这是泽莫男爵
This is Baron Zemo.

458
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,650
你也听过他的名字  对吗
I know you've heard of him, too, right?

459
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,510
你看起来是个很聪明的人
You seem like a pretty smart guy.

460
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,870
所以你最好赶紧把知道的都说出来
So you better become conversational real quick.

461
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,750
不如让我提个建议
How about a counter proposal?

462
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,010
条件开得再好点  我就开口
Make me a better offer and I'll talk.

463
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,870
兄弟们  来了一伙人
Guys, we have company.

464
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,480
城里所有的赏金猎人都来了  我们得走了
Every bounty hunter in the city is here. We gotta go!

465
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,400
好吧  我说
Okay. Okay.

466
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,130
西伯利亚的五个测试对象失败后
I was brought into HYDRA's

467
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,210
我加入了九头蛇的冬日战士计划
Winter Soldier program to pick up their work

468
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,210
接手他们的工作
after the five failed test subjects in Siberia.

469
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,890
九头蛇没落后  我被中情局招募了
When HYDRA fell, I was recruited by the CIA.

470
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,050
他们有一个试验对象的血液样本
They had blood samples from an American test subject

471
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,640
这个美国人体内有半稳定的血清痕迹
with semi-stable traces of serum in his system.

472
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,190
经过一番努力
After much labor, I was able

473
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,300
我在他的血液中分离出了必要的化合物
to isolate the necessary compounds in his blood.

474
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,750
我真是太神了
I was a god.

475
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:25,400
我做出了自厄斯金以来无一科学家做得出的成果
I did what no other scientist since Erskine was able to do.

476
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,680
但是我的成果与之不同
But mine was going to be different.

477
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,420
没有笨重的机器  没有壮到扭曲的身体
No clunky machines or jacked up bodies.

478
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,120
我的成果将会是精细的  最优化的
Mine was going to be subtle, optimized,

479
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,630
完美的
perfect.

480
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,790
那我们怎么从来没有听说过
How have we never heard about this?

481
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,080
因为
Because...

482
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,680
我还没来得及完成我的工作就化成了灰
Before I was able to complete my work, I turned to dust.

483
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,340
等我回来已经是五年后了
Then when I returned, it was five years later,

484
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,140
项目已经被废弃  所以我来了这里
program had been abandoned, so I came here.

485
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,490
权力掮客非常乐意
The Power Broker was more than happy

486
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,150
赞助我复原实验
to fund the recreation of my work.

487
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,110
你做了多少支
How many vials did you make?

488
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,850
20支
Twenty.

489
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,550
卡莉·摩根索把那些偷走了  所以
Karli Morgenthau stole those, so...

490
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,600
我只能想象
I can only imagine

491
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,420
权力掮客计划对那个可怜的女孩做什么
what the Power Broker has planned for that poor girl.

492
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,800
-卡莉现在在哪  -我不知道
- Where's Karli now? - I don't know where she is.

493
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,990
但是几天前
But a couple of days ago,

494
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,040
她打来问我
she called and asked

495
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,230
能不能帮一个叫唐妮娅·迈丹尼的人
if I could help someone named Donya Madani.

496
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,050
那可怜的女人得了肺结核
Poor woman has tuberculosis.

497
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,070
安置营里人员过于密集
Typical of overpopulation

498
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,260
这种病再典型不过
in displacement camps like that.

499
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,780
她最后怎么样了
Well, what happened to her?

500
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,630
不归我管  我也管不着
Not my pig. Not my farm.

501
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,110
这里还有血清吗
Is there any serum in this lab?

502
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,930
没有了
No.

503
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:16,980
现在怎样
Now what?

504
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,830
伙计们  我们真没时间了
Guys, we're seriously outta time here.

505
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,170
不
No!

506
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,380
你干了什么
What did you do?

507
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,130
有人看到泽莫了吗
Anybody see Zemo?

508
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,020
快走
Let's go.

509
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,090
好了  等我的信号
All right! Wait for my signal!

510
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,790
该死
Damn it!

511
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,810
你还说喜欢住在这里
And you like living here?

512
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,390
也不算太糟
It's not terrible.

513
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,460
-不是要走左边吗  -你走错方向了
- I thought we were going left? - You went the wrong way!

514
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,280
我是在开路
I was clearing the way!

515
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,420
我先出来的  你该跟着我才对
I came out first. You're supposed to follow me.

516
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,460
-结果现在怎样  -各位  现在不是吵架的时候
- And where are we now? - Guys, not the time!

517
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,550
-我没子弹了  -这是个街垒
- I'm out! - This is a barricade.

518
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,080
每部动作片里都演过
It's in every action movie!

519
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,050
-走  -快  我们走
- Go. - Come on. Let's go.

520
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,010
巴克
Buck!

521
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,140
快走
Let's go!

522
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:51,750
你好啊
Hello...

523
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,960
是增压跑车哦
Supercharged.

524
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,460
你要回监狱去
You're going back to jail.

525
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,990
你们还想不想找到卡莉了
Do you want to find Karli or not?

526
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,410
他是对的  我们需要他
He's right. We need him.

527
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,870
而且我们只有两个人  他们至少有20人
And there's two of us, and at least 20 of them.

528
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,500
-上车  -行吧  但你再敢擅作主张...
- Come on. - Fine. But if you try that shit again...

529
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,670
我连想都不会想
I wouldn't dream of it.

530
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,080
真是别开生面的重聚
Well, that was one hell of a reunion.

531
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,740
跟我们回美国吧
Come back to the States with us.

532
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,840
我说了我不能
I told you I can't.

533
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,890
把你答应我的特赦令弄来再说
Just get me that pardon you promised me.

534
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,590
谢谢你做的一切
Thanks for everything.

535
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,210
你是不打算把座椅调直了  是吧
You're not gonna move your seat up, are you?

536
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,860
对
No.

537
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,260
我们有大麻烦了
We've got a big problem.

538
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,170
其实是一系列大麻烦
Actually, a couple of them.

539
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,700
我上车跟你说  走
I'll tell you in the car. Let's go.

540
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,330
{\an8}立陶宛  维尔纽斯
全球回归委员会补给站

541
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
拐角那边还有个入口
There's another entrance around the corner.

542
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,110
你有想过抽些时间哀悼吗
Have you thought about taking some time to mourn?

543
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,650
-我们不用现在就动手  -就得现在
- Look, we don't have to do this right now. - Yes, we do.

544
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,300
你想象过自己会在这里做这些吗
Did you ever think you'd end up here, doing this?

545
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,960
我一直摸索着想找条出路
I was always scrambling for a way out, you know.

546
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,320
甚至在某一刻想过参军
Even thought about jumping in with the military,

547
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,190
但...
at one point, but, uh...

548
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,720
显然在马德里坡做黑帮打手挣得更多
apparently mob security in Madripoor paid better.

549
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,300
我一直以为自己会做老师
I always thought I'd be a teacher.

550
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,110
就像唐妮娅老师一样
Like Mama Donya.

551
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:36,640
可能教教...历史或美术什么的
Maybe, like, History or Art or something.

552
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,650
卡莉·摩根索教授
Professor Karli Morgenthau.

553
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,530
在马德里坡干这行可不容易
Bit of a tough profession in Madripoor?

554
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,950
从没想过我会去那里
Never thought I'd end up there,

555
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,260
但当那些消失的人都回来了
but then when everybody returned,

556
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,420
而我们又被扔到了大街上
and we got put out on the street,

557
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,720
我知道只有那里
I knew it was the only place

558
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,330
才有我能用来保护我们的东西
that had something that I could use to protect us.

559
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,830
还记得我们注射血清时
Do you remember how scared we were

560
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,310
有多害怕吗
when we took the serum?

561
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,090
我感觉血管都在燃烧
Felt like my veins were on fire.

562
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,660
祈祷着干脆死了算了
Prayed it'd kill me.

563
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,690
但那是值得的  因为这个世界是我们的了
But it was worth it, because this world is ours.

564
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,640
本该是唐妮娅老师的
Should have been Mama Donya's.

565
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,570
我们要用尽一切力量
We're gonna use all of our strength

566
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,650
把世界交给安置营的孩子们
to give it to the kids in those camps.

567
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,610
你知道权力掮客的人
You know, the Power Broker

568
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,650
最终会逮到我们的  对吧
is gonna catch up with us eventually, right?

569
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,950
那不是问题
That's not a problem.

570
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,220
内格尔在马德里坡被杀了
Nagel was killed in Madripoor.

571
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,770
最后的血清在我们手里
We've got the last of the serum.

572
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,090
权力掮客会来求我们的
The Power Broker is about to come begging.

573
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,680
那我们接下来只有最后一场战斗了
So we just have the one fight ahead of us then?

574
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,950
我愿意赌一把
I'll take those odds.

575
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,520
等这一切结束  也许你还能当老师
Maybe you get to be a teacher after all this is over, right?

576
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,450
也许吧
Maybe.

577
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,630
万事俱备了
We've got all we need here.

578
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,860
你说山姆和巴基
You said that Sam and Bucky

579
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,390
事发当天也来过这里吗
were here on the same day this happened?

580
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,680
没错  你不是认为
Correct, you don't think

581
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,280
他越狱和他俩有关系吧
they had anything to do with him getting out, do you?

582
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,140
-谢谢你  -什么
- Thank you. - What?

583
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,030
你真认为山姆和巴基
So, you seriously think Sam and Bucky

584
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,820
会协助泽莫这种人越狱吗
would've broken a guy like Zemo out of prison?

585
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,480
我就是这么想的
That's exactly what I think they did.

586
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,700
他们和我们一样  迫切想找到线索
They were desperate for leads like us.

587
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,430
别这样
Come on, man.

588
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,280
你再清楚不过了
You know it damn well

589
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,630
没证据我们就不能指控那是他们干的
we can't accuse 'em of something like that without evidence.

590
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,610
所以你和我
Which is why you and I

591
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,200
先跟进此事
are just gonna run with this one for a minute.

592
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,410
好吧  这么说接下来的行动
Okay, so I take it what happens next

593
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,410
严格来说不合规矩  对吗  队长
isn't a strictly on-the-books type thing, is it, Cap?

594
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,300
莱玛  如果我们能完成任务
Lemar, if we get the job done,

595
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,760
你以为他们还会追问我们的手段吗
you really think they're gonna sweat us on the how?

596
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,100
唐妮娅·迈丹尼  她是难民
Donya Madani. She's a refugee, yeah.

597
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,320
-好  我去查  -有发现就联系我
- Okay, I'm on it. - Okay. Call me if you get a hit.

598
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,570
没问题
Will do.

599
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,780
谢了  托里斯
Thanks, Torres.

600
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,110
你还好吗
You okay?

601
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,920
嗯
Yeah.

602
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,670
就是在想
Just thinking about all the shit

603
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,590
莎伦之前受的苦
Sharon had to go through.

604
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,390
还有内格尔提到艾赛亚那些美国实验对象时
And Nagel referring to the American test subject

605
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,690
都没把他们当人看
like if Isaiah wasn't even a real person.

606
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,050
我不禁思考
Just makes me wonder

607
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,980
为了给这块大铁饼让路
how many people have to get steamrolled

608
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,120
有多少人得被碾过
to make way for this hunk of metal.

609
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,530
那要看你问的是谁了
Well, it depends on who you ask.

610
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,510
那块大铁饼救了很多人
That hunk of metal saved a lot of lives.

611
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,550
我知道  行了吧
Yeah, I get that. All right.

612
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,960
也许是我做错了
Maybe I made a mistake.

613
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,390
-你是错了  -好吧
- You did. - Yeah.

614
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,610
也许我不该把它放进博物馆的
Maybe I shouldn't have put it in a museum.

615
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,410
我就该摧毁它
Maybe I should have destroyed it.

616
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,130
听着  那面盾对很多人来说
Look, that shield represents

617
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,790
都有着非凡的意义  包括我
a lotta things to a lotta people, including me.

618
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,770
如今世界天翻地覆
The world is upside down,

619
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,520
我们需要位新队长  但不能是沃克
and we need a new Cap, and it ain't gonna be Walker.

620
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,610
所以在你摧毁盾前
So before you go and destroy it,

621
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,750
我会亲自从他手里拿走
I'm gonna take it from him myself.

622
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,630
嗯  嗯
Yeah. Yeah.

623
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,590
好
Okay.

624
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,960
谢了  做得很棒
Thanks. Good work.

625
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,240
他们找到迈丹尼了
They found Madani...

626
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,730
她死了
Dead.

627
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,960
死在里加  一个靠近波罗的海的城市
She died in Riga, a city near the Baltic Sea.

628
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,750
我们有个地方可以去
I have a place we can go.

629
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,100
我个人
I, for one,

630
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,620
很期待和卡莉正面交锋
am looking forward to coming face to face with Karli.

631
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,060
奥兹尼克  我们改变航线
Oeznik, we're changing the course.

632
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,610
迭戈  伦诺克斯  第二辆货车
Hey, Diego! Lennox! Second van.

633
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,060
这么多物资足够了
It's the motherlode.

634
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,870
足够供给整个营地
Enough for a whole camp.

635
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,930
他们就干放着这些物资不用
They're just sitting on this stuff.

636
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,550
好了  都好了吗
All right. We good?

637
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,130
肮脏的碎旗者
Filthy Flag Smashers.

638
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:35,210
你们把能用六个月的物资
You had six months' worth of supplies,

639
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,000
就放在那栋建筑里不动
just sat there in that building.

640
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,000
你不明白吗  我们在搏命
Don't you understand? We're fighting for our lives.

641
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,930
-卡莉  你不开车吗  -不
- Karli, aren't you taking your car? - No.

642
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,890
系上安全带  快
Put your seat belt on. Now!

643
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,520
该死
Shit!

644
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,680
里面还有人
There were still people in there.

645
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,710
跟这些人只能用暴力沟通
This is the only language these people understand.

646
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,620
{\an8}拉脱维亚  里加

647
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,790
我听说了索科威亚的命运
I heard what became of Sokovia.

648
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,610
地上的碎石还没清理干净
Cannibalized by its neighbors

649
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,960
就被邻国蚕食了
before the land was cleared of rubble,

650
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,780
从地图上被抹掉了
erased from the map.

651
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,070
你俩应该都懒得去看纪念碑吧
I don't suppose any of you bothered visiting the memorial?

652
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,920
当然  何必
Of course not. Why would you?

653
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,610
我们到了
We are here.

654
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,730
我要去散散步
I'm gonna go on a walk.

655
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,330
你还好吧
You good?

656
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,250
嗯  等会见
Yeah. I'll see you guys in a bit.

657
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,180
你掉东西了
You dropped something.

658
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,150
我还在想你什么时候会出现
I was wondering when you were gonna show up.

659
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,680
{\an8}我是为泽莫而来
